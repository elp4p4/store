1. I used CSS Framework (Bootstrap) responsive components: Navbar (with dropdown button), Breadcrumb, Pagination, Modal.
2. Product Section Design (TVs, Laptops, Cellphones): I listed product one by one with "buy now" button once you click on it, a Modal appears to fill it up with informations.
3. Color Scheme: Gray and Red and White with Black color of text.
4. Footer Design: Added some social media icons that will redirect you to the desired webpage once you click on it.
